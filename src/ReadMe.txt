This version of the (yet) uncompleted Metermaid is using ArduinoJson 5.
At this point, this project is going to be split off into a new branch to
continue development with ArduinoJson 6.
This means that many of the functions will have to be re-done.
Eventually I plan to merging the changes back into this main branch.
